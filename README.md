## Stock + Web Scraping Ideas
- Scrape MadMoney transcripts to see how much the market follows Jim
	- Figure out stocks and if Jim recommends buy or sell and see following week or month to see how stock performs after recommendation
	- archive.org has cnbc transcripts
- Continue working on IPO data analytics 
	- Analyze company numbers, industry, and other catagories to see if there are any predicting factors/ trends
	- Might want to add how S&P is doing overall to check for overall market trend
